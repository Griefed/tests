### About Pre-Releases

Do not release or publish a server pack generated using a pre-release of ServerPackCreator to your users.
If you do, and it turns out that your server pack doesn't work because of a bug in ServerPackCreator, that's on you for using a pre-release.

#### Alphas

Alphas are feature-incomplete and very likely to have bugs.
Before submitting an issue, please check the corresponding [milestone](https://git.griefed.de/Griefed/ServerPackCreator/-/milestones) of this releases major version to see whether an issue for yours already exists there.
Doing so saves both you and me a lot of time. Thanks in advance!

#### Betas

Betas are feature-complete and probably have bugs. Additional features *may* be added during the beta-phase of any given release, though.
